-- How can you output a list of all members who have recommended another member? Ensure that there are no duplicates in the list, and that results are ordered by (surname, firstname).


select distinct recs.firstname as firstname, recs.surname as surname
	from 
		cd.members mems
		inner join cd.members recs
			on recs.memid = mems.recommendedby
order by surname, firstname;
