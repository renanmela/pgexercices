-- We want to alter the price of the second tennis court so that it costs 10% more than the first one. Try to do this without using constant values for the prices, so that we can reuse the statement if we want to.

update cd.facilities facs
    set
        membercost = (select membercost * 1.1 from cd.facilities where facid = 0),
        guestcost = (select guestcost * 1.1 from cd.facilities where facid = 0)
    where facs.facid = 1;
