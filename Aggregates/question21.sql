-- Based on the 3 complete months of data so far, calculate the amount of time each facility will take to repay its cost of ownership. Remember to take into account ongoing monthly maintenance. Output facility name and payback time in months, order by facility name. Don't worry about differences in month lengths, we're only looking for a rough value here!

select 	facs.name as name,
	facs.initialoutlay/((sum(case
			when memid = 0 then slots * facs.guestcost
			else slots * membercost
		end)/3) - facs.monthlymaintenance) as months
	from cd.bookings bks
	inner join cd.facilities facs

	group by facs.facid
